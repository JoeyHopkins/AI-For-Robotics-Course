P1Location.py:
This is code from the first Assignment. 
My theoretical robot is about to use statistics to determine its location on a map given a known map, 
  a list of scans from determining the color of its location, 
  and a list of movements.

p2_1DKalmanFilters.py
Using measurement updates and predictions, the theoretical robot is able to calculate an objects next estimated location in a 1d space

p3_KalmanFilters
Similar to the previous one but with a 2D space. Deals with x, x_velocity

p4_4DKaymanFilter.py
Worked out starting matrix to work in a 4d space. Deals with x, y, x_velocity, y_velocity
